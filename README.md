#**The Life of Cailyn**

Cailyn Clemons

Hello! My name is Cailyn Clemons and I am a recent graduate of Tuskegee University with a degree in Biology and a special interest in Epidemiology and Public Health. After my gap year, I plan to enter graduate school to obtain a Masters in Public Health and then apply to a doctoral program to obtain a Doctorate of Public Health degree. With a MPH and DrPH, I aspire to become a Field Epidemiologist or Infectious Disease Epidemiologist so that I can contribute to the field of public health by working in the field or laboratory and conducting quantitative research. With a career in Public Health, I plan to track infectious diseases worldwide to help solve public health problems at both a population and community level and to design and implement preventative strategies. My long-term goal is to earn a position in Epidemiology at the CDC as either a Field Epidemiologist or Infectious Disease Epidemiologist.
